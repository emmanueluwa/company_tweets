# Company Tweeter

- Utilising a transformer model to generate informative /entrtaining tweets for a company / individual

- Automatically insert them into the web page

- Potentially have a personal assistant mode that tweets automatically when button is clicked

# Technology

- This will be a chrome extension

- I will use javascript

- I will use hugging face inference API

- - host langauge models and run inference on them, make predictions through the API, utilise the hugging face cloud infrastructure to host things independently without having to use openAPI API keys

- - the tweets generated using the inference API hosting on huggingface, they will then be injected into the twitter page
